----------------------------------
To Compile:
-Run (in folder): g++ -std=c++11 main.cpp -o cacheCalc
-Execute: ./cacheCalc
Note* Takes a couple mins to get the values imported into the program, so transactions will read
zero for a second, but after awhile Output will transition followed by a final output with the result of the program.
